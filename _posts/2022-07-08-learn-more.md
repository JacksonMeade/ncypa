## Who We Are

Democracy is built upon the representation of constituents. Unfortunately, political leaders often leave young people’s voices unheard. As high schoolers, our founders, Sam Hiner and Mick Tobin learned this firsthand. Whether it was addressing traffic safety or condemning partisan power grabs, their emails, calls, and visits to politicians seemed to lead to little policy change compared to lobbyists and political bureaucrats. We are tired of politicians disregarding young people and failing to prioritize the future of our country. The stakes are higher than ever, and with democracy under threat, Sam, Mick, and their quickly growing movement are committed to transforming youth power in North Carolina. 

## Our Work

We are mobilizing students at six NC universities to vote and advocate for youth-centered policy. We have student-led organizer teams at Duke University, East Carolina University, High Point University, NC State University, UNC-Chapel Hill, and UNC Charlotte. At each of these schools, our members are actively advocating for no-class Democracy Days. On Democracy Day, there would be no classes and a range of civic engagement programs. It would be held two weeks before Election Day, giving ample time for same-day registration during early voting. Data from the National Survey of Voting, Learning, and Engagement shows that schools with no classes on election days saw a 12% increase in student voting compared to those without. With Democracy Day, NCYPA aims to mobilize 2,000 - 3,000 students to vote at each school1. Overall, if Democracy Day is implemented at the 7 NC universities, NCYPA will mobilize 18,000 new NC voters, transforming youth political representation in NC. 

Civic engagement is at the core of our operations. Each month, we host voter registration drives, local legislator speaker events, and watch parties at our seven schools. Through these events and education on our social media pages, we give young people the tools to act.
