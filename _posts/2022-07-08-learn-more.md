## Who We Are

Democracy is built upon the representation of constituents. Unfortunately, legislators, civic nonprofit leaders, and other political figures often leave young people’s voices unheard. As high schoolers, our founders, Sam Hiner and Mick Tobin learned this first hand. Whether it was traffic safety concerns or legislation to stop partisan power grabs, their emails, calls, and visits seemed to have little weight compared to lobbyists and other entrenched groups. As young people, we are tired of politicians disregarding young people, and with us, the future of our country. The stakes are higher than ever, and with democracy under threat, Sam, Mick, and their quickly growing movement are committed to transforming youth power in North Carolina. 

We mobilize students at colleges across the state to vote and advocate for policy change that young people care about. Currently, our members are advocating for Election Holidays at their universities, helping more of their peers make it to the polls. By mobilizing students, we are building a large coalition of young voters and advocates who are ready to put pressure on elected officials to prioritize youth-focused change.

We are a group of young people who are tired of being ignored by politicians. Our founders, Sam Hiner and Mick Tobin, began their advocacy in high school, cold-calling legislators to grow support for pro-democracy legislation that addressed overlooked problems that could pave the way to major, anti-democratic power grabs. After seeing how their advocacy rarely translated into legislative action, especially compared to lobbyists and other powerful constituents, they started the NC Young People’s Alliance to build youth power in North Carolina.
