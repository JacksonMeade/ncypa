Givebutter description: We have recruited top student leaders across the state who are ready to dedicate themselves to our program, mobilizing young voters at unprecedented levels. However, we need to hit our fundraising goal by August in order to give them the resources to do this work.
Thank you for supporting our effective student advocacy work. As a young organization seeking to break the status quo, we rely on grassroots contributions from donors like you.

Givebutter thank you: Thank you for supporting our work. With your help, we will be able to get thousands more young people out to vote and build a youth movement that holds politicians accountable.
